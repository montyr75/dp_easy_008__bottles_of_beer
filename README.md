A Polymer Dart program that prints out the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" using a loop to minimize the need to type the lyrics in code. The song can be printed using either numerals or spelled-out numbers as the user desires.

The app also demonstrates using an SVG file as the source for a `<paper-button>` icon, and it uses the ["Denim" Polymer theme](https://polymerthemes.com/denim/).
